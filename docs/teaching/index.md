## Scholarship in Teaching and Learning
 I completed a Teaching and Learning Certificate through the MacPherson Institute in the 2023-2024 academic year, which included courses on pedagogy and a research paper titled "Exploring Physics' Negative Reputation and the Implications on Physics Education". 
 
 Simultaneously, I was involved with the Student Partners Program, getting further experience with the scholarship of teaching and learning. Along with my supervisors Dr. Pat Clancy and Dr. Miranda Schmidt, we developed a longitudinal survey to examine students' attitudes toward their programs and courses in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at McMaster University. The long-term goal of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of undergraduate physics programs.
