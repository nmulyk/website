#About me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics at McGill University. My [research](./research/index.md) primarily focuses on Fast Radio Bursts, short bursts of radio waves emitted by unknown sources in distant galaxies, utilizing the CHIME Radio Telescope. Previously, I completed a Master's of Science in Physics and Astronomy at McMaster University. My MSc thesis examined the application of image recognition machine-learning software to identify historic supernova light echoes. I did my bachelor of science in my hometown of Edmonton, AB at the University of Alberta.

I am also passionate about [teaching](./teaching/index.md), [outreach](./outreach/index.md) and improving the astronomy community uphold the values of [equity, diversity, and inclusion](./edi/index.md). 

Outside of academics, I am an avid knitter, crocheter, and fibre artist. I also enjoy baking, hiking, stargazing, and snuggling with my two cats: Max and Bella.
